**Project Description:** This repository contains scripts and documentation related to the data acquisition and wrangling process for our project. Data acquisition involves collecting raw data from various sources, while data wrangling involves cleaning, organizing, and transforming this data into a format suitable for ploting.

Contents

**Acquisition Scripts:** Here, you'll find scripts used to retrieve data from different sources. These scripts may include code for accessing  databases

**Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** This section covers the steps involved in cleaning and preprocessing the acquired data. It includes scripts or notebooks that demonstrate how we handle missing values, outliers, duplicates, change dtype and any other data quality issues.

Data Integration: In this part, we discuss how we integrate data from multiple sources. This may involve combine datasets, Concatenate datasets for analysis.
Detect and remove outliers  
Check the skewness and correlation of variables
